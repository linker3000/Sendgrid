# Sendgrid
Info on Sendgrid templates and API stuff 'cos the official online docs are sometimes wrong or just not well written.

This is stuff I have figured out while working on a Sendgrid mailing project. The repo was inspired by the fact that sometimes the Sendgrid API docs are less than helpful, don't have good examples or are just plain wrong (need updating?). I also wasted time following advice on various 'support' and code 'exchange' sites because they were also wrong or referred to older APIs or now deprecated features. 

Putting it here for posterity and in case it helps someone else.

Oh, I suppose I'd better put: This stuff is provided 'as is', use at your own risk etc. I am just quickly copying/pasting useful work notes. If you spot anything that doesn't look right please let me know.
